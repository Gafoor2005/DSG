# 🏗️ Architecture Documentation

This folder contains technical architecture decisions, system design patterns, and strategic documentation for the Social Platform Microservices project.

## 📋 Documents

### [`implementation-roadmap.md`](./implementation-roadmap.md)
**Comprehensive 14-week development roadmap**
- Phase-by-phase implementation plan
- Service dependency mapping
- Technical architecture for search and recommendation systems
- ML pipeline design
- Priority matrix and critical path analysis

### [`service-communication-strategy.md`](./service-communication-strategy.md)
**Service communication patterns and decisions**
- HTTP vs Message Queue analysis
- When to use synchronous vs asynchronous communication
- Redis queue implementation strategy
- Kafka/RabbitMQ evaluation
- Performance and reliability considerations

## 🎯 Architecture Principles

### Current Decisions
1. **HTTP-first communication** for synchronous operations
2. **Event-driven architecture** for async operations (future)
3. **Microservices with Docker Compose** for local development
4. **API Gateway pattern** for centralized routing and auth
5. **Database per service** pattern

### Future Considerations
- Message queue integration (Redis → RabbitMQ → Kafka)
- Service mesh evaluation (Istio)
- API versioning strategy
- Event sourcing patterns
- Distributed transaction handling

## 🔄 Evolution Plan

| Phase | Communication Pattern | Complexity | Timeline |
|-------|----------------------|------------|----------|
| **Current** | HTTP Direct | Low | ✅ Complete |
| **Phase 2** | HTTP + Redis Queues | Medium | Weeks 5-8 |
| **Phase 3** | HTTP + RabbitMQ | High | Weeks 9-12 |
| **Phase 4** | Full Event-Driven | Very High | Weeks 13+ |
